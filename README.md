# MeshMakerVS
Uses OpenFrameworks to create a mesh using Structure Core Depth and RGB Data. Will be used for occlusion for AR. Also takes in OSC input from Vive Controller to move the camera around. 

To Get Structure Core working with Visual Studio and OpenFrameworks:

May need to add Structure.dll to Win32 System Folder

If Structure Core SDK is updated, move Structure folder from SDK into bin folder of MeshMaker project, replacing the existing Structure Folder.
